#Building the Docker Image for IBM MQ 
##Requirements
- a running Docker Machine
- ```git``` installed 
- ```maven``` installed

##Setup
Everything is pretty much in the provided shell scripts for ease of use. They have been named appropriately for each activity. Feel free to open them up and see how they work. 

#####Create a customizeable Docker image using the mq-docker git project (https://github.com/ibm-messaging/mq-docker.git)
This script will check out the require git repository and build a base ibm/mq8 image, then build a new image from that with the estreaming/ namespace. 
```bash
$./docker_build.sh
```

#Running the Docker Container 

#####Run the container
You will be propmted for a couple of parameters. The defaults are fine for this exercise.
```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ ./docker_run.sh 
fs.file-max = 524288
Enter the Queue Manager name: QM1
Enter the port number: 1414
9b4705ac01d1ecb5cc5ce6fa75050da68751528dc05b29472d3e8cf983b5f412
```

####Turn on Authentication 
By default, there is no authentication required to connect to the Queue Manager (see Dockerfile). The documentation for the github mq-docker image specifes that specifying security settings in a file that is COPYied to /etc/mqm/config.mqsc will apply security to the Queue Manager but this seems to not be working. So Security without any customization is applied. So if you want the authorization/authentication to be maintained on privileged users then as specified in conf/config_clauth_on.mqsc then run this script. You can verify settings by running the ```docker_exec_run_runmqsc.sh``` script to upen up a ```runmqsc``` session on the container then running a ```DIS QMGR``` and look for the ```CONNAUTH( )```entry - if there is some value in between the parenthesis then security in some form is still on. 

```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ ./docker_exec_apply_auth.sh
```

####Turn off Authentication 
If you don't want any authentication/authorization on the Queume Manager then run this script. 

```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ ./docker_exec_apply_auth.sh
```

#####Destroy the container
```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ ./docker_destroy.sh
```

#Running the Client Code to put a Message on the Queue

####Install the IBM MQ V8 JMS client jars 
IBM does not provide any open sourced or public maven accessible jars to connect to MQ. They do happen to be available in the Docker server image itself so you can obtain them from there. First run the script in the ```mq``` folder called ```docker_exec_cp_mq_client_jars``` to copy them from the running container to the ```mq/lib``` folder, then run the ```mq/mq-jms-client/mvn_install_mq_client_jars.sh``` to install the to the local maven repository. You should see each one install. There are about 8 jars to install this way.

```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ cd mq-jms-client
[vagrant@estreaming mq-jms-client]$ ../docker_exec_cp_mq_client_jars.sh
[vagrant@estreaming mq-jms-client]$ ./mvn_install_mq_client_jars.sh
...

```

####Create a Queue

MQ requires that a Queue be defined on the server first so first thing is to create that Queue. Run the ```docker_exec_run_runmqsc.sh``` script to upen up a ```runmqsc``` session on the container OR just run the Docker exec command as shown below. You will be prompted for a Queue Manager name, that is the same as the one you entered when you started the container. Then run the ```DEFINE QL(<queue-name>)``` where `<queue-name>` is the name of the Queue ("QUEUE1" is the default in the client code but if you change it you will be prompted for that later when you run the program). You will then compile the program and be prompted for details about the installation by running the ```test_mq_installation``` script. After it runs, you should see a success message at the end

```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq-jms-client]$ docker exec -ti estreaming_ibm_mq8_broker runmqsc # OR ../docker_exec_run_runmqsc.sh from this directory
Enter the Queue Manager name: QM1
5724-H72 (C) Copyright IBM Corp. 1994, 2015.
Starting MQSC for queue manager QM1.


DEFINE QL(QUEUE1)
     1 : DEFINE QL(QUEUE1)
AMQ8006: WebSphere MQ queue created.


```

####Compile and Run the Client program
```bash
[vagrant@estreaming mq]$ ./test_mq_installation.sh
